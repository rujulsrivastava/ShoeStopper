Hey!
This project has been a chance at exploring my interests, abilities and approach to computer science.
It has allowed me to expand my logic and at the same time create something I absolutely loved.
It may not be the best, but it has allowed me to widen my horizons much better than any other project
from the internet could have. It has helped me better my skills at programming. I look forward to making more
of fun projects like these.

Some instructions:
1) Right-Left keys to move right-left
2) Spacebar to jump
3) Don't touch the notes!
4) There are 4 levels with increasing number of obstacles.
5) Instructions will always be displayed alongside the gaming window in the python shell.
6) To quit, click the X button on top right corner.
